# Submissions

We welcome submissions from folks who live in a co-op or have experience living in co-ops. Note that we do *not* pay for articles. This is a volunteer run blog that doesn't make any money.

**If you just have an idea:** Feel free to pitch us on  it! We'll let you know if it is the kind of thing we would post before you go through the trouble of writing it all up. You can reach us at info@conviviality-cooperatives.com.

**If you have a full written piece::** Please submit the following to info@conviviality-cooperatives.com.
- Your name as you want it to appear on the article. Just a first name, an initial, or even anonymous is fine.
- Your bio as you want to to appear at the top of your article. Just one-to-three sentences is fine.
- A brief description of your co-op living experience. We won't publish this, it's just so we can get a sense of where you're coming from.
- Where you currently live. Just the city is fine. We won't publish this, it's just so we can get a sense of where you're coming from.
- Whether you are okay with us performing minor editing to your piece (spelling, grammar, etc.) before publishing it. Otherwise we will run any such changes by you before posting.
- Your piece itself! If possible, just put it directly in the body of the email, rather than in an attachment.

Thanks for your interest and contribution!
